## About

#### Disclaimer
Loot Clicker was one of the first games I ever programmed, and a lot of the code is **very** haphazardly put together. I'm mostly uploading this repository for archival purposes. The only change I made to the code before uploading it was removing the [Newgrounds](http://www.newgrounds.com/) advertising API keys.

#### Art
The art of the game, designed by [Oryx](https://twitter.com/oryxdesignlab), is not included in this repository. A license for the art used can be purchased via [this link](https://www.oryxdesignlab.com/products/ultimate-roguelike-tileset).

#### License
Loot Clicker is released under the GNU General Public License v3.0, see the [LICENSE](./LICENSE) file for details.

If you ever use my code for any of your projects, feel free to let me know on Twitter! [@TrampolineTales](https://twitter.com/TrampolineTales)
